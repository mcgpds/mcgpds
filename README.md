## 1. MATLAB current directory
Change the current working directory in MATLAB to  the 'McGPDS_code'

## 2. The directory structure of the code (located in the './code/matlab' directory).
- The 'source' and 'demo' directories hold the main code.
- The 'dataset' directory holds the dataset files.
- The 'mvcgpdsResultMat' stores the optimized model files for reference only, which may provide some inspirational information for debugging model parameters of other datasets in the future.
- Other files are some related toolkits.

## 3. Run the code
The main program entry of the code is the 'MVCGPDStutorial.m' file in the 'McGPDS_code folder' and execute 'MVCGPDStutorial.m' to run.
