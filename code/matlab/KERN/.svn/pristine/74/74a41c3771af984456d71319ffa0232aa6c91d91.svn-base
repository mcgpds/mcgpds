% SDLFMAXSDLFMAKERNGRADIENT Gradients of cross kernel between 2 SDLFM kernels.
%
%	Description:
%
%	[G1, G2, COVGRADLOCAL] = SDLFMAXSDLFMAKERNGRADIENT(SDLFMVKERN1,
%	SDLFMKERN2, T1, COVGRAD, COVIC) computes a cross gradient for a
%	cross kernel between two switching dynamical LFM kernels for the
%	multiple output kernel. Both kernels are accelerations.
%	 Returns:
%	  G1 - gradient of the parameters of the first kernel, for ordering
%	   see lfmKernExtractParam.
%	  G2 - gradient of the parameters of the second kernel, for ordering
%	   see lfmKernExtractParam.
%	  COVGRADLOCAL - partial derivative wrt the initial conditions of
%	   the first interval.
%	 Arguments:
%	  SDLFMVKERN1 - the kernel structure associated with the first SDLFM
%	   kernel (acceleration).
%	  SDLFMKERN2 - the kernel structure associated with the second SDLFM
%	   kernel (acceleration).
%	  T1 - inputs for which kernel is to be computed.
%	  COVGRAD - gradient of the objective function with respect to the
%	   elements of the cross kernel matrix.
%	  COVIC - covariance for the initial conditions
